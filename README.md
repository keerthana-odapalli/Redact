# Redact
The ever-growing demand for data privacy and security in various sectors necessitates the development of efficient tools that allow for the safe handling of sensitive information.
"RE-DACT" is a machine learning based redaction tool designed to obfuscate, anonymize, and mask sensitive data across multiple formats such as text files, images, PDFs, and videos.
The tool offers a gradational redaction scale, enabling users to define the degree of redaction based on their preferences, while ensuring that the output remains structurally similar to the original data.
RE-DACT effectively removes identifiable content, leaving the underlying logic intact.
A key feature of the tool is its ability to generate realistic synthetic data over time, providing users with anonymized datasets suitable for sharing, learning, and collaboration, without exposing sensitive information
